# Medical-Appointment-Analysis
This project highlights the potential of big  data analytics in improving healthcare outcomes and patient experiences.
By analyzing the Medical Appointment dataset, insights can be gained on various aspects of the 
restaurant In this notebook we will try to analyze why would some patient not show up for his medical 
appointment and whether there are reasons for that using the data we have.
We will try to find some correlation between the different attributes we have and whether the patient 
shows up or not. The dataset we are going to use contains 110.527 medical appointments and its 
14 associated variables (PatientId, AppointmentID, Gender, ScheduledDay, AppointmentDay, Age, 
Neighborhood, Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism, Handcap', SMS_received, 
No_show)
